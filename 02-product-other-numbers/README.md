# Problem 02 - Product of other numbers
# 
# Write a function get_products_of_all_ints_except_at_index() that takes an array of integers and returns an array of the products. 
# For example, given: [1, 7, 3, 4]
# your function would return: [84, 12, 28, 21]
# by calculating: [7*3*4, 1*3*4, 1*7*4, 1*7*3]
# Do not use division in your solution.
